# How to contribute

Thank you for taking to time to contribute to our wonderful project.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Intro](https://github.com/Ernaldis/Biology-Data-Logger/blob/master/README.md) is a brief overview of our project
  * [Code of conduct](https://github.com/Ernaldis/Biology-Data-Logger/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) tells you what the rules are
  
## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Ernaldis/Biology-Data-Logger/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Timothy Chandler, Lonestar Montgomery Computer Club
