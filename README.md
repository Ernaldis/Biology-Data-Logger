Biology data logger
-------------------

The biology department has requested our club write a program for them.
They are running an experiment with [MudWatt](https://www.magicalmicrobes.com/products/mudwatt-clean-energy-from-mud).
They want to know which mud samples are the best by testing what different samples can digest.
They do this with [Eco-Plate](https://biolog.com/products-portfolio-overview/microbial-community-analysis-with-ecoplates/).

We have several goals for this project:
<details>
	<summary>Gather experiment data</summary>
	* Student Name
	* Voltage Output
	* Eco-plate Results
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Store the data</summary>
	* Log the results of the experiment to a database
	* We intent to use an SQL database for this project
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Interpret Results</summary>
	* Allow users to query previous experiments
	* Give users tools to analyze the results
	* Provide a calculated ideal Ecoplate for maximum voltage output
</details>
